 Hello. Hello, good evening. Good evening. Hello. Hi, how are you? Can you hear me? Yeah, speaking. How are you doing? This is Daisy from Food and Market. How are you doing? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I've read your reviews. Yeah, I'm not going to go ahead with it. Go ahead. May I know why, please? Pardon? May I know why exactly? So can you elaborate more on that? No, it's just with the reviews and I don't feel comfortable. That's all you need to know. Okay. And what, well, we're constantly trying to improve our business, so any kind of feedback, negative or positive, is helpful. So if you may, you know, tell me more reasons. Yeah, you, the feedback is on Google. You just need to read Google reviews. Google reviews. So I don't feel comfortable. Yeah, I don't feel comfortable. And that's all you need to know. Okay. No, I understand that completely. And I'm so sorry to bother. We're on Trustpilot as well. But in any, in any given, you know, maybe in the future, if you can give us another chance, and I'm sure we'll satisfy your business needs. Yeah, again, maybe if your reviews improve, then maybe, but yeah, I just don't feel comfortable doing this. That's okay. I understand that completely. I will take a look. So I try to understand the reason why exactly, and maybe I'll get back to you next week. No, no. If anything, if I change my mind, I'll reach out to you guys. That's perfect. You know, you have the website, your account is for free. All you need to do is log in, see the prices, the suppliers and everything. We come with a full pack of service, by the way. So when you place your order, then you're going to have an account manager, kind of like your personal assistant. They will do everything for you, organize your products, your orders, and even check with the invoices and, you know, keep track on everything. Yes. No problem. Thank you so much for your feedback, Juan. Thank you. Have a lovely day. Bye-bye. You too. Bye-bye. Bye
